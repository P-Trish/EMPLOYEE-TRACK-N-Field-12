# EMPLOYEE-TRACK-N-Field-12

## Description

This project is an employee tracker built from scratch through the command-line applcation. It utilizes the console.table, dotenv, inquirer, and mysql2 packages and dependencies.  This application can be used to manage a company's employee database.  The motivation for this project is to take on the user story: 
"AS A business owner
I WANT to be able to view and manage the departments, roles, and employees in my company
SO THAT I can organize and plan my business,"
and create the application to solve this problem.

The Employee Tracker is developed for business owners, aiming to offer them a solution for managing and coordinating their employee roster.

By offering a simplified interface for users to interact with their data through the command line, the project addresses the challenge of database interfacing.

By building this Employee Tracker, I learned to further implement the packages and dependencies of console.table, dotenv, and mysql2.  I also learned how to read and write database and use them in javaScript.
